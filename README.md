# Deep Learning Model Development

## Overview
This project focuses on designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models using TensorFlow.
The objective is to build an effective model through proper data preprocessing, architecture design,
and performance evaluation.

## Project Objectives
- Develop deep learning models for prediction and classification tasks
- Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and validation
- Evaluate model performance using quantitative metrics and visualizations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Methodology
- Collected and prepared a custom dataset
- Applied data preprocessing and normalization techniques
- Designed and trained deep learning architectures
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and loss metrics

## Model Interpretability (Grad-CAM)
To enhance model transparency and interpretability, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied.
Grad-CAM visualizations were used to highlight the regions of input images that most influenced model predictions.
This approach helped validate that the model focused on meaningful features rather than background noise,
improving trust and qualitative evaluation of the deep learning model.

## Results
- Achieved high classification accuracy on validation data
- Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed that the model focused on relevant regions of interest
- Improved interpretability and confidence in model predictions
